# Cultural-Preservation-Heritage-Project

# Introduction
Digital curation entails carefully selecting, organizing, and contextualizing digital content to preserve its worth and relevance. This procedure frequently involves filtering through massive volumes of data to discover elements of significance based on criteria such as historical value, relevance in culture, or scientific significance. Once selected, these items are organized in a logical manner, frequently incorporating metadata and classification mechanisms to enable quick access. Furthermore, offering context using annotations or descriptions enhances the understanding and usability of curated digital resources, assisting academics, scholars, and the public in successfully browsing and interpreting the content.

Digital preservation, on the other hand, is concerned with maintaining the lifespan and availability of digital assets throughout time. It entails using strong retention techniques and equipment to protect against loss of information, degradation, or corruption. Using redundant storage facilities, reliable information centers, or solutions based on the cloud could be examples of this. Furthermore, preservation measures include regular backups, which allow for retrieval of data in the event of inadvertent deletion, cyber-attacks, and technological breakdowns. Digital safeguarding ensures the worth of digital assets are available and used for future generations as well as protecting our digital history and knowledge.

Digital curation and preservation procedures are critical for ensuring the integrity, availability, and usability of digital material. Because of the rapid advancement of technology, digital files are vulnerable to depreciation, degradation, or loss. Curation that is effective enables the picking and structuring of valuable material, increasing its relevance and facilitating navigation. Preservation protects data from fraud, advancements in technology, or failures in the system, assuring long-term access and preventing data loss. These practices are critical in a variety of sectors, including academia, business, and cultural institutions, as they preserve our digital legacy and provide future generations with ongoing access to vital content.

The project aims to preserve and research the effects of WWII Underwater Cultural Heritage in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI).
